RiggingToolbox
==============

Usefull services for rigging using Fabric Engine


The Rigging Toolbox is intended to be open and customizable according to productoins requirements. 

We will provide production relevant kinematics and deformer operators that can be combind together using a deformation stack and rendered directly to the DCC viewport.

The Deformers will provide good examples of how GPU compute can be used on production problems to provide significant speed boost over CPu based evaluation.
